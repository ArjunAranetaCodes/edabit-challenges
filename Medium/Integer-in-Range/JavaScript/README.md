Integer in Range?

Create a function which validates whether a number n is exclusively within the bounds of lower and upper. Return false if n is not an integer.

Examples
intWithinBounds(3, 1, 9) ➞ true

intWithinBounds(6, 1, 6) ➞ false

intWithinBounds(4.5, 3, 8) ➞ false
Notes
Exclusively means that a number is considered not within the bounds if it is equal to the upper bound (see example #2).
Bounds will be always given as integers.
