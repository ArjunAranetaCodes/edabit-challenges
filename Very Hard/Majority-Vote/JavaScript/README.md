Majority Vote

Create a function that returns the majority vote in an array. A majority vote is an element that occurs > N/2 times in an array (where N is the length of the array).

Examples
majorityVote(["A", "A", "B"]) ➞ "A"

majorityVote(["A", "A", "A", "B", "C", "A"]) ➞ "A"

majorityVote(["A", "B", "B", "A", "C", "C"]) ➞ null
Notes
The frequency of the majority element must be strictly greater than 1/2.
If there is no majority element, return null.
If the array is empty, return null.
