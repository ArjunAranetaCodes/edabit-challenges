Frames Per Second

Create a function that returns the number of frames shown in a given number of minutes for a certain FPS.

Examples
frames(1, 1) ➞ 60

frames(10, 1) ➞ 600

frames(10, 25) ➞ 15000

Notes
FPS stands for "frames per second" and it's the number of frames a computer screen shows every second.
Assume the screen produces 60 frames every second.
