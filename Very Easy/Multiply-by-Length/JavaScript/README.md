Create a function to multiply all of the values in an array by the amount of values in the given array.

Examples
multiplyByLength([2, 3, 1, 0]) ➞ [8, 12, 4, 0]

multiplyByLength([4, 1, 1]) ➞ ([12, 3, 3])

multiplyByLength([1, 0, 3, 3, 7, 2, 1]) ➞  [7, 0, 21, 21, 49, 14, 7]

multiplyByLength([0]) ➞ ([0])
Notes
All of the values given are numbers.
All arrays will have at least one element.
Don't forget to return the result.
