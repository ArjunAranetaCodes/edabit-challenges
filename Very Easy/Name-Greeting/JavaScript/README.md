Name Greeting!

Create a function that takes a name and returns a greeting in the form of a string. Don't use a normal function but use an "arrow function".

Examples
helloName("Gerald") ➞ "Hello Gerald!"

helloName("Tiffany") ➞ "Hello Tiffany!"

helloName("Ed") ➞ "Hello Ed!"

Notes
The input is always a name (as string).
Don't forget the exclamation mark!
