Smaller String Number

Create a function that returns the smaller number.

Examples
smallerNum("21", "44") ➞ "21"

smallerNum("1500", "1") ➞ "1"

smallerNum("5", "5") ➞ "5"
Notes
Numbers will be represented as strings, and your output should also be a string.
If both numbers tie, return either number.
Numbers will be positive.
Bonus: See if you can do this without converting to integers.
