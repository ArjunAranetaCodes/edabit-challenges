Alphabet Soup

Create a function that takes a string and returns a string with its letters in alphabetical order.

Examples
AlphabetSoup("hello") ➞ "ehllo"

AlphabetSoup("edabit") ➞ "abdeit"

AlphabetSoup("hacker") ➞ "acehkr"

AlphabetSoup("geek") ➞ "eegk"

AlphabetSoup("javascript") ➞ "aacijprstv"
Notes
You can assume numbers and punctuation symbols won't be included in test cases. You'll only have to deal with single word, alphabetic characters.
