Fix the Error: Mutating Arrays

Suppose I want to define a function that removes the last element of an array each time I call it, but does not mutate the original array. Fix the code so that the results are no longer mutating the array.

function minusOne(arr) {
  arr.pop()
  return arr
}
Examples
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
minusOne(x) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4]  // 1st time function is called.
minusOne(x) ➞ [1, 2, 3]  // 2nd time function is called.
minusOne(x) ➞ [1, 2]  // 3rd time function is called.
minusOne(x) ➞ [1]  // 4th time function is called.

// What I want instead:
minusOne(x) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4]  // 1st time function is called.
minusOne(x) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4]  // 2nd time function is called.
minusOne(x) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4]  // 3rd time function is called.
minusOne(x) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4]  // 4th time function is called.
