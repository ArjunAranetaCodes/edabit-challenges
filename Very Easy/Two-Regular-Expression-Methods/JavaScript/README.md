Two Regular Expression Methods

There are three methods (exclude compile) that you can use with regular expression literals. Use these two methods to fix the code. One method returns a boolean if there is a match. The other method returns an iterator from a search.

Notes
Do not use the same method twice.
Do not use String methods that accept regular expresssions as arguments.
