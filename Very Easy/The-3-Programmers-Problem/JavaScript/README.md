The 3 Programmers Problem

You hired three programmers and you (hopefully) pay them. Create a function that takes three numbers (the hourly wages of each programmer) and returns the difference between the highest-paid programmer and the lowest-paid.

Examples
programmers(147, 33, 526) ➞ 493

programmers(33, 72, 74) ➞ 41

programmers(1, 5, 9) ➞ 8
