Squares and Cubes

Create a function that takes an array of two numbers and checks if the square root of the first number is equal to the cube root of the second number.

Examples
checkSquareAndCube([4, 8]) ➞ true

checkSquareAndCube([16, 48]) ➞ false

checkSquareAndCube([9, 27]) ➞ true
Notes
Remember to return either true or false. All arrays contain two positive numbers. If you're stuck, check Resources for a hint.
