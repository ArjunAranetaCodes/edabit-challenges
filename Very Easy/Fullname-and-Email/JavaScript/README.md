Fullname and Email

Create the instance properties fullname and email in the Employee class. Given a person's first and last names:

Form the fullname by simply joining the first and last name together, separated by a space.
Form the email by joining the first and last name together with a . in between, and follow it with @company.com at the end. Make sure everything is in lowercase.
Examples
emp1 = Employee("John", "Smith")
emp1.fullname ➞ "John Smith"

emp2 = Employee("Mary",  "Sue")
emp2.email ➞ "mary.sue@company.com"

emp3 = Employee("Antony", "Walker")
emp3.firstname ➞ "Antony"
Notes
The properties firstname and lastname are already made for you.
