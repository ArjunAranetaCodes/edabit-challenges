Re-Form the Word

A word has been split into a left part and a right part. Re-form the word by adding both halves together, changing the first character to an uppercase letter.

Examples
getWord("seas", "onal") ➞ "Seasonal"

getWord("comp", "lete") ➞ "Complete"

getWord("lang", "uage") ➞ "Language"
