ES6: Destructuring Objects VIII

Using basic object destructuring you can assign variables name and email:

let { name, email } = { name: "John", email: "john@example.com" }

console.log(name)  // "John"
console.log(email)  // "john@example.com"
What if there were more properties but you didn't want to write variables for all them and just wanted to stick them into another object and do something like this:

let { name, email, rest} = { name: "John", email: "john@example.com", city: "Phoenix", state: "AZ", country: "USA"}

rest ===  { city: "Phoenix", state: "AZ", country: "USA"} // true
There is something you have to do with the variable name rest in order to assign it an object containing the rest of the object properties. You can find out how in the MDN docs in the Resources tab.

Use the rest syntax to change the code so that rest = {city: "Phoenix", state: "AZ", address: "USA"}. Only edit the left side of the assignmet { name, email, rest }. Ignore the .toString() function (used for validation).
