RegEx: Character Classes IX ‚Å†- \w

You can think of character classes as characters with special meaning. They are recognized as special when you place the \ before the character.

Here is a list of the character classes in JavaScript:

., \cX, \d, \D, \f, \n, \r, \s, \S, \t, \v, \w, \W, \0, \xhh, \uhhhh, \uhhhhh, [\b]
There is a hidden word in this string:

const str = "**^&$Regular#$%Expressions$%$$%^**"
Write the regular expression that reveals the hidden word. You have to remove all of the special characters to reveal the word. Use the character class \w in your expression.
