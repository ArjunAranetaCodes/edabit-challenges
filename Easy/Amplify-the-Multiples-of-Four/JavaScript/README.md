Amplify the Multiples of Four

In this challenge, you must generate a sequence of consecutive numbers, from a lower bound that will always be equal to 1, up to a variable given higher bound (including the bounds in the sequence).

Each number of the sequence that can be exactly divided by 4 must be amplified by 10 (see notes below).

Given a higher bound num, implement a function that returns an array with the sequence of numbers, after that every multiple of 4 has been amplified.

Examples
amplify(4) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 40]
// Create a sequence from 1 to 4
// 4 is exactly divisible by 4, so it will be 4*10 = 40

amplify(3) ➞ [1, 2, 3]
// Create a sequence from 1 to 3
// There are no numbers that can be exactly divided by 4

amplify(25) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 40, 5, 6, 7, 80, 9, 10, 11, 120, 13, 14, 15, 160, 17, 18, 19, 200, 21, 22, 23, 240, 25]
// Create a sequence from 1 to 25
// The numbers exactly divisible by 4 are: 4 (4*10 = 40), 8 (8 * 10 = 80)... and so on.
Notes
The given parameter num will always be equal to or greater than 1.
Remember to include the num as the higher bound of the sequence (see the Examples) above.
A number a amplified by a factor b can also be read as: a * b.
A number a is exactly divisible by a number b when the remainder of the division a / b is equal to 0.
