Calculate an Earned Run Average

Create a function that returns an Earned Run Average (ERA). An ERA is calculated by multiplying 9 by the quotient of Earned Runs Allowed er divided by ip Innings Pitched.

In baseball statistics, innings are represented with a fractional part of .1 (1/3) or .2 (2/3) to represent the number of outs in an inning. A whole number or a number with a fractional part of .0 represents a full inning with three outs. Check the Resources tab for a deeper explanation.

Examples
era(22, 99) ➞ 2.00

era(23, 99.1) ➞ 2.08

era(24, 99.2) ➞ 2.17
Notes
ERA is represented with a scale of 2: 2.08
For 1/3 and 2/3, use a scale of 2.
